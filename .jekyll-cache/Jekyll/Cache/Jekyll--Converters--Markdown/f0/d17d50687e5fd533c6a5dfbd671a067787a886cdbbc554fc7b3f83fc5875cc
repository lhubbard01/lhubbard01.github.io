		<p>This is a relatively quick and simple outline of some important tools for cloud infrastructure and cloud native architecture. I opersonally figured some may find the stuff I have been reading up on useful, the internet is a vast place, and there is admittedly so much out there. At any rate, pages corresponding to these techologies will be added as I (hopefully) have time to further describe them.  The structure of these descriptions will aim to be consistent.First, I will describe the technology only brielfy.Then, I will motivate the technology with a problem that it aims to solve.Once we have a problem that provides an ample solution space fit for our technology under consideration, I will describe how it solves that example problem.Finally, I will give context to it in the wider scope of how it has changed the industry. If I write about a technology more in depth, I will do this in a more involved format that will be less rigidly constrained to this template, but still generally adhering to this overall structure.</p>

					<h3>The Rundown: Infrastructure</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Cloud centric infrastructural design considerations are often difficult to describe, partially due to the intellectual proprietary nature of the material, and partially due to the disconnect between academic computer science curricula and industry needs.  That's a pretty heady way to say "yeah, they built their business on it and a lotta people dont really know about it because they weren't exposed to it in college, haha". But I digress... </p>
				<p> I have two favorite resources for bridging the gap</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Youtube channels and media for conferences dedicated to these topics (oftentimes containing hilarious "story times" and useful case studies)</li>
					<li>O'Reilly Safari and the media on its platform (seriously, this stuff is so great)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Here are some iuseful descriptions I made, partly for myself because there is no better way to learn something than by explaining it. I encourage you to seek out the mentioned resources earlier, and I will provide links to resources I found useful during my study of these technologies, since I am by no means expert in them. Happy hunting!</p>
