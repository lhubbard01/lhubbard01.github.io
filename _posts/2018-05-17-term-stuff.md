homebrew: use this to download stuff.  It is a great way to quickly find packages and libraries that are commonly used. This will need to be downloaded from the web, but upon installation, you can use it to download the other extensions.
"brew install whatever"  

oh-my-zsh: a z shell that will be used on top of your bash. It's pretty, useful, and intuitive.  I've used it ever since download.  Makes the terminal experience so much more enjoyable.  http://ohmyz.sh

ack: a useful tool that will recursively traverse file trees, searching contents of files for the specific regular expression you provide it.  Searching libraries has never been easier.


.bashrc / .zshrc: located in your home directory (cd ~), it runs all the commands used upon initialization of a new terminal session. This is great for setting terminal environment variables and aliases.  Get to know it

Vim: I love vim. one-day learning curve, forever productivity increase. Terminal based text editor.  Look up vim tutorials.  can configure it through your ~/.vimrc . Once you're done with vim, make sure you install vim key bindings on your IDE of choice. USing vim key bindings with Intellij has streamlined so much for me.  If you don't use an IDE, in this day and age.... what are you doing?
