Git is a really powerful and useful tool.  There is no question about that, and the reason you are here is probably because it's not only powerful and useful, but also incredibly complex. To be sure, a lot of the features are simple enough to figure out on one's own, but to know them effectively requires working with them for a long time.  Because of this, I will share my stumbling over git rebase, so you don't have to.

Working with large code bases with important and business-critical interdependencies has necessitated the use of version control.  I'm able to develop a lot of my own stuff locally while others are working on their sprint tasks. We all can share a mainline from where only the reviewed and prod-ready stuff is stored, and be able to pull those changes in to our own local stores.		Personally, I like to have a separate git branch for each task I'm working on for a sprint.  It makes code reviews easier because there is a logical separation on a per-task basis. Maybe I will have a separate commit for a small, but impactful update, allowing for our shared git log to track these important changes that might affect other places unexpectedly.  This is all fine and good, but lets say I need to merge some stuff, and then rebase after that merge.  This can get unexpectedly wild, and it definitely freaked me out when I was rebasing and then saw most of my changes disappear.  I was very stoked to show off some changes I had made, having spent three hours at home debugging some weird behaviors associated with unit testing. Three hours of perusing the internet and stack exchange and documentation for a specific bug that was a pretty big blocker, and it had all been wiped away by a single command... or so I had thought. It turns out, this is actually not anything to worry about. Git is a local database of different branches and respective iterations of code. As one merges or moves their changes on to another branch, merge conflicts will most likely occur. In fact, the behavior of git is to pause, on a per commit-related merge-conflict basis, to allow for choosing between the conflicting bodies of code.  So, a new branch is created and named to support this intermediary step, necessary for ensuring the right stuff is used. After this, git add . will add your changes to the commit that is being repositioned on top of the head you are rebasing on to. After this, `git rebase --continue` is used to move on to the next commit in your rebasing that will need to be merged.  The intermediary merge conflict decision branches can be greater than 1 (in fact, I had to rebase 8 the other day), so it can be a somewhat arduous process, but your code will be consistent with whatever you are rebasing on to, which is really nice for readable mainline logging of additions and decisions. Eventually, you will enter your final `git rebase --continue`, at which point you will have completed your rebasing, and your branch will be consistent and on top of the branch you rebased on to.  

A useful tool for rebasing is "interactive rebase", called by `git rebase -i`. What this does is allow you to specify commit behaviors during rebasing, and a list of all your commits you are potentially rebasing will be displayed.  Here, you can choose how you want each commit to be treated during rebasing, which can actually be very useful.  The page that is pulled up is essentially an editable input file to the rebasing program, so the functions that are associated with each command are executed.

Typically, there would be many commits, which would all, by default, be `pick`. Going through this process, you will inevitably run in to the conflicts I mentioned earlier. When I had started on this and had my emotional rollercoaster ride over the work I thought I had lost, I was told by a coworker of a tool technically referred to as `git beautiful-champion-of-gracious-revival` . No not really. Running `git reflog` will open a log of state transitions, each with the HEAD pointer referencing these states.

So, its important to note here that this is a very small reference log. You might have to scroll deep within your list (which is actually hosted by vim, so you can vim your way around it) to find locations you might care about. Why would you want to find any location in here? Because pointing HEAD to that location will load the state of the git workspace at that time.  By running `git reset --hard HEAD{5}` for example, you will have all the code associated with that associated HEAD{5} state loaded.   So basically all your changes are immortal and you have `beautiful-champion-of-gracious-revival` to thank for this. Now, with great power comes great responsibility, and you could potentially mess a lot of stuff by resetting willy-nilly, so you have been warned.
