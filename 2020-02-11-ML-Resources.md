Tsundoku - To acquire reading materials, only allowing them to pile up. 



Here are some resources I have found to be useful for the two courses I took in ML this quarter.  
Specifically, they are more mathematically oriented, at least relative to what most casual enthusiasts of ML have come to expect. 
I would say that the more of the math you familiarize yourself with, the more successful you will be with the material in general.
Completing all of the exercises in these books will be a powerful differentiator in the quality of your skillset.
I also encourage you to seek out resources or answers as you go along, so as to make sure you are indeed on the right track.


This is all very tough material.
I am certainly not finished with this list;  I am not even remotely close.
However, I learned of these texts and felt that others may find this material useful as well. 
I will try and add more to it as I go. 



Machine Learning dedicated texts
- "Machine Learning, a Probabilistic Perspective", Murphy
- "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", Bishop
- "Machine Learning - An Algorithmic Perspective", Marsland - this is the course text for one of the ML classes


Probability And Statistics Section
- "All of Statistics", Wasserman - very useful and organized presentation of statistical foundations
- "All of Nonparametric Statistics", Wasserman
- "An Introduction to Probability", Bertsakas and Tsitsiklis


Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus
- "Coding the Matrix - Linear Algebra Through Computer Science Applications", Klein
- "Matrix Algebra Theory, Computations, and Applicaitons in Statistics", Gentle

Miscellaneous
- "The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory", Vapnik - An analysis of behaviors guaranteed given a specific model prototype, by the creator of Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- "An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning", Sutton and Barto - foundational text for reinforcement learning algorithms
- "Decision Theory, a Brief Introduction" - Ove Hannson
