		<h3>Some fun background</h3>
	</header>
<p>Here are some resources I have found to be useful for the two courses I took in Machine Learning in winter 2020</p>
<p>The courses were taught by a very erudite and polymathic machine learning engineer, and now officially PhD of Mathetmical Sciences. You should expect to be overwhelmed and hopefully left feeling under prepared. That's a good place to be, since it means you are self aware enough to know how much you don't know.  It's tough applied math that is literally doctoral and state of the art, so if you also feel a bit imposter-ish, remember so does everyone else.  ly, they are more mathematically oriented, at least relative to what most casual enthusiasts of ML have come to expect. Machine Learning Engineers wouldn't get paid nearly as much if it were easy. Haha just kidding, youre stupid.
</p>
<p>At any rate, I would say that the more of the math you familiarize yourself with, the more successful you will be with the material in general. It is tough and requires practice and time to sink in. Proceed gradually and consistently. 
Completing all of the exercises in these books will be a powerful differentiator in the quality of your skillset.  I also encourage you to seek out resources or answers as you go along, so as to make sure you are indeed on the right track. 
</p>
<p> Also I just want to make it clear, the Tsundoku definition referenced at the beginning of this page is very intentional and pertinent.  I have about 20 papers downloaded and meant to be read, and still mean to further explore the virtual ICLR conference content. It should go without saying then...</p>
<p> That I am certainly not finished with this list;  I am not even remotely close. However, I learned of these texts, many from this professor, and felt that others may find this material useful as well. I will try and add more to it as I go.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong> don't let yourself feel important by just having these books in your backlog.  Its so easy to do and it will not help you move forward with the material.  But don;t try to do it all in one evening either, this is the kind of stuff that takes years to master.</p>
