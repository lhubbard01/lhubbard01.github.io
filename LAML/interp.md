			<h3>The familiar Unknown</h3>
		</header>

			<p>One of the most compelling outcomes of deep learning's successes is the visualization of neuron-specific optimized behaviors. The visuals are always fun to look at and ponder, why are they so foregin yet so familiar? But they also allude to something far deeper: The components of neural computation.  </p>
			<br/>
			<p>In what ways you may wonder? The niche and multidisciplinary concentration of feature engineering was the workhorse of the "handwritten" models. These endeavored to, well, model difficult statistical and perhaps ineffable computations and functional approximations, algorithmically. To put it more concretely, one example is edge detection.  Prior to learned convolutional filter based models, such feature detection was handwritten and hard coded into these models. </p>
			<p>This should sound like immense undertaking, though to the more ambitious, from their naivete, maybe this seems more attainable? After all, MIT Researchers in 1961 founded their vision lab for computational vision research and anticipated solving the problem of vision by the end of that same summer.

			<h3>To Conquer the Unknown Unknown</h3>

			<p>Each step of further inspection into the specific reveals a new world, alien to our anticipation. From our skin, to the cell, to the molecule, to the atomic, to the subatomic, and recursively further, we have explored the end we once knew to be the end, or the bottom, or whatever have you. Within each layer and the layers between, fields of scientific inquiry have produced their own wealth of knowledge that has only grown with finer tools. 
			So it seems to be the case with neural computation. Indeed, it may reveal the nature of our own perception, and even if it doesn't, it would instead reveal the nature of a similarly powerful vehicle for computation.  </p>
			<br/>
			<p>The underappreciated youth of this field hints at a vast uninvestigated trove of discoverables. This is where the unknown unknowns reside, and where perhaps we are humbled by nature once more. A portion of OpenAI's team has thus ventured towards these ends, albeit with a lack of cultural fanfare. For those of you that have read this far, entertaining my vague waxing to the poetic, <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/">here is the sauce</a></p>
