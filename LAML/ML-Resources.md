		<p>This portion is under construction, there will be a big dump of resources when I feel there's enough content for this portion to be useful. For the time being, the Books tile contains some great content I encourage investigating! The Conferences section contains a reference to a great visual tool for navigating this years International Conference on Learning Representations that is pretty cool, which I also highly encourage viewing</p>
