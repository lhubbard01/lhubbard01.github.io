I will try to synopsize all the papers listed with an expanding window once I figure out how those work, and when I have the time for each. 
Foundational Papers
These papers are some that I consider, likely among many others, as fundamentally important to defining modern machine and deep learning.

					<p>Perhaps the foundational proof supplying reason for its tremendous and unprecedented interest.</p>
					<p>Perhaps similarly important but underrecognized, is this paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03429">On the Turing Completeness of Modern Neural Network Architectures</a> which demonstrates the capacity of internal dense representations for furnishing Turing completeness</p>

					<p>Foundationally important in highly complex generative distributions, achieved through a clever application of Game Theory. Specifically, two models compete against each other, through training towards different ends.  A generator creates data that a discriminator is tasked on discerning its either synthetic or true nature.  A generator aims to get better at tricking the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to minimize its error in its classification. Generative models are useful for many reasons, but to be succinct, they allow for data generation and dataset augmentation.  As neural networks require a data rich training regime, a scarcity of data yields an underdetermined system, thereby failing to be useful in generalization.  This space is notably teeming with research, and the state of the art is being improved daily.</p></dd>
